First and most importantly: Thanks to all of you for your support!

This was an amazing experiment we ran together. It was really great to see how all of you actively participated using the hola bot and the YouTube chat. We even had some special guests videocalling all the way from Spain! There's a lot of other cool stuff that unfortunately I won't be able to use live anytime soon. 

So, to put it shortly, let's say the 1st season is over. I hope one day I'll be able to come up with an easier setup and better hardware, so that I can smoothly have a talking show while cooking.

One more time, thanks to you for being there! Happy new year, best wishes and hopefully see you soon!
