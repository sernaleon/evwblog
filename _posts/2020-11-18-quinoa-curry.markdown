Hi there! 

Next **Wednesday 18-Nov-2020 at 18:30** I'll cook **Quinoa curry**. 

Here's the link to the YouTube streaming: [https://youtu.be/iz8y4XdBVKA](https://youtu.be/iz8y4XdBVKA)

I'll be using these ingredients for 2+ hungry persons:
- 1 broccoli
- 1 cauliflower
- 3 carrots
- 1 chili pepper
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 can (400gr) brown beans (if you use dry one plz cook them before the show)
- 1 can (400ml) coconut milk
- Curry powder
- 200g white quinoa
- 30 grams of nuts (I'll use cashew nuts & pecans)

This is what I'll use, but of course, feel free to make it your way. Add/remove ingredients as you wish, or even cook/do whatever you want while watching the streaming. At the end of the day is about chatting a bit :)

Hope to see you there!
