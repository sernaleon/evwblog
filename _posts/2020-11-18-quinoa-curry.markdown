Hi there! 

Next **Wednesday 18-Nov-2020 at 18:30** I'll cook **Quinoa curry**. 

Here's the link to the YouTube streaming: https://youtu.be/iz8y4XdBVKA

Do you want to join? Here's the grocery list (serves 2 hungry persons):
- 1 broccoli
- 1 cauliflower
- 3 carrots
- 1 can (400gr) brown beans (if you use dry one plz cook them before the show)
- 1 chili pepper
- 1 can (400ml) coconut milk
- 2 cloves garlic
- Curry powder
- 200g quinoa

This is what I'll use, but of course feel free to make it your way. Add/remove ingredients as you wish, or even cook/do whatever you want while watching the streaming. At the end of the day is about chatting a bit :)

Hope to see you there!
