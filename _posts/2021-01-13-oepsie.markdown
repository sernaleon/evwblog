Easy vegan Wednesdays.. what an amazing little adventure! So many learnings in just 2 episodes.. To mention a few, OBS (the software I used for streaming), the hola chatbot, this blog... and even more experiments that I never got to try out. 

Not to mention the amazing crowd following the show :) But it's time for a little break and a recap.

The next show will take place a bit later, on **January the 13th at 18:30**

More info to come, so stay tuned :)

Enjoy you holidays and hopefully see you around next year!
