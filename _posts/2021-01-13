<p>Easy vegan Wednesdays.. what an amazing little adventure! So many learnings in just 2 episodes.. OBS (the software I used for streaming), the hola chatbot, this blog... and even more experiments that I never got to try out. Not to mention the amazing crowd following the show :) But it's time for a little break and a recap.</p>
<p>The next show will take place a bit later, on <strong>January the 13th at 18:30</strong></p>
<p>More info to come, so stay tuned :)</p>
<p>Enjoy you holidays and hopefully see you around next year!</p>
